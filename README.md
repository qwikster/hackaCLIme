## HackaCLIme
A CLI terminal app to read time tracked on Hack Club's Wakatime modification, known as Hackatime!

## Installation
`pip install hackaclime`

## Usage
Make sure you've set up your Hackatime, and have a .wakatime.cfg file. Run `hackaclime` in your chosen terminal emulator. If you'd like to change your theme, do so - you may also create a custom theme from there, as long as you have the RGB or hex values. HackaCLIme comes prepackaged with about 15 commonly used themes (or at least my interpretation of their colors - some aren't too clear with the docs), and your current theme is saved. To open a user, open the https://hackclub.slack.com, and select any user, then open their profile and select Copy Member ID from the kebab menu. It should look something like `U091JJ2JF8E`.

## Themes
A utility to create custom themes is included, or you can make yourself in `hackaclime.cfg`!
